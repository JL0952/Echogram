     * model's context when the current platform doesn't support it, its part of
     * the reply-format rules, and its entry in the composer's "+" menu. A platform
     * lists the features it supports; the chat history itself never changes.
     *
     *   contextPolicy 'strip'    the tag is removed from the context
     *   contextPolicy 'degrade'  the tag becomes a plain-text note ("[Transfer: ¥52.00]")
     *
     * Context filtering works on canonical tags, so run it on text that has been
     * through RichMessages.normalizeMessageTags().
